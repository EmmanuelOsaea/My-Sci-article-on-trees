**Tree Breeding and the Problem of the Environment**
The discovery of genetic gain to the forest grower is one of the most important drivers for commercial tree breeding programs (e.g., [15]). Tree breeding is a well-developed methodology [16] but remains constrained by a number of factors. These include the number of trees that can be measured, the accuracy of the measurements, the number of sites that can be sampled and the ability to accurately model individual genetic effects amongst the environmental variation. An additional layer of complexity lies with the ability to transfer predicted gain into meaningfully operational genetic gain in the forest.

Tree breeding is currently based on the use of linear mixed models to partition trait variance into genetic and environmental components [16]. The environment is represented as sites where experimental plantings are established. Ideally, sites should represent all conditions where trees will be grown, but this is not operationally feasible. Factor analytic models have helped with understanding the interplay of genetics and environment (e.g., [17]). A fundamental constraint remains in that it is not reasonable to expect discrete ‘sites’ to be representative of the whole forest. Describing and understanding the plasticity of genotypes at a landscape scale is still required.

**Conclusions**
Tree breeding techniques (e.g., modern selection, breeding, and testing methods) are of course of paramount importance in pursuing improved quality of commercial conifers for traits of interest. Important techniques in tree breeding that have developed over recent years mainly revolve around field-test designs, mating designs for advanced-generation breeding, and many specialized procedures to assess traits of interest. New areas of research and program management are required in the areas of conservation of genetic variation, deployment patterns for improved varieties, special traits that require innovative assessment and selection systems, molecular genetics and genomics, multiple population breeding, and genetic management information systems. Of utmost importance, however, is that tree breeding programs consider the simplest and most effective methods that can be handled by the organization in realistic time frames.

**Conclusions**
Tree breeding programs develop genetically improved varieties for forestation through repeated cycles of activities such as selection, breeding, and genetic testing. Selection aims to increase the frequency of favorable alleles of a few important traits, while breeding re-creates and repackages genetic variation so that still better selections can be made in the next cycle of selection. Nearly all programs rely on a breeding strategy involving recurrent selection for general combining ability, which means that genetic tests are used during each cycle of breeding to rank the parents in the breeding population and increase gains from selection. Thus, designing, implementing, and analyzing genetic tests are critical aspects of tree breeding programs that must be done well to maximize genetic gain per unit time at minimum cost. Tree breeding programs vary widely in design, breeding strategy, and intensity owing to differences in species' biology, breeding objectives, and economic considerations. Nevertheless, tree breeding is an integral part of operational silviculture for most plantation forestry programs in the world. New technologies such as tissue culture to achieve operational planting of tested clones, marker-assisted breeding to increase gain from selection, and genetic modification to insert novel genes all have promise to enhance gains from tree breeding, but must be tested for effectiveness, safety, and public acceptance.

**Introduction**
Tree breeding programs, also called tree improvement programs, create genetically improved varieties for reforestation and afforestation. As with breeding programs of agricultural crops and animals, these programs aim to change allele frequencies for a few key traits of a given species through repeated cycles of activities such as selection, breeding, and genetic testing. Today, tree improvement is an integral component of most plantation programs in the world with the ultimate goal being to increase the economic and social value of the planted forest. Unlike annual crops, trees are long-lived and difficult to work with due to their size. This means that, while the concepts of tree breeding and crop breeding are similar, the details differ greatly.

Owing to differences in species' biology, silviculture, product goals and economic considerations, tree improvement programs for distinct species differ dramatically in both design and intensity. Nevertheless, there are basic concepts and activities common to most programs. The aim here is to describe these common activities and the underlying theory on which they are based.

**2 Breeding methodologies**
Conventional plant breeding has been a long-driven process of selection (based on the phenotype) and crossing of elite varieties to generate superior varieties (in terms of yield and quality, ease of cultivation, harvest, and processing, tolerance to abiotic stresses, and resistance against pests and pathogens) through genetic recombination.

Fruit tree breeding is hindered by factors such very long generation time, significantly big size, long juvenile period of seedlings, and difficulty in assessing a product till a seedling reaches physiological maturity (Luby and Shaw, 2001). Moreover, several biotic and abiotic stresses have an impact on quality and quantity of the produce, adding to the complexity for genetic improvement. In this regard, genomics-based tools have offered great promise to circumvent such difficulties. Techniques such as the genome-wide association study (GWAS) have become useful for studying quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes using large collection of cultivars or germplasm lines (Iwata et al., 2016).

The goal of a plant breeding exercise is to simultaneously stack all the beneficial traits in a particular variety. However, this goal is made challenging because of some traits of interest linked to pleiotropic effects, huge quantitative loci, epistatic gene effects, environmental conditions, and other unanticipated changes. Nevertheless, conventional breeding has yielded several varieties over years with improved agronomic traits that are presently cultivated throughout the world. With the advent of molecular markers and genome sequence information, precision breeding is now practical to introduce trait/s for better agronomic characteristics. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used earlier to distinguish the parents and offspring carrying a particular chromosomal segment. SSRs have been used to study population structure, genetic diversity analysis, genetic mapping, and marker-assisted selection of elite cultivars. Recently, several SSR markers were identified in sugarcane and jute (Saha et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). However, presently single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data are available for high-throughput genotyping (Chagné et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2019; Gemenet et al., 2020). Plants with polyploid genome usually reproduce through asexual means and show poor genetic variability, which is true for many horticulture plants. Moreover, most of the horticulture plants were domesticated based on the phenotypic characteristics and cultivated widely, thereby reducing the molecular variability. Horticulture industry is based on a select few varieties with unique quality that is consumer-oriented and thus leads to cultivation of only those few varieties. This reduces the available gene pool for improvement. Seedless fruits have become an acceptable commodity and are produced by breeding and biotechnological methods (Varoquaux et al., 2000). Other examples of breeding horticulture plants that transformed food industries and markets include MD2 Gold pineapple (Bartholomew et al., 2012), super sweet maize (Steffensen, 2000), pineapple strawberry (McLaughlin, 1996). The conventional breeding approaches are difficult for introducing beneficial traits in these plants. Thus, alternative methods of breeding that include induced somaclonal variation, mutagenesis, and hybridization are practiced. Biotechnology revolution in the previous century rationalized breeding strategies for improving horticulture plants that included in vitro propagation, embryo rescue, protoplast fusion, marker-assisted selection, and transgenic technology (Suprasanna et al., 2017). Transgenic methods of crop improvement require prior information about the gene and its importance for a trait to be introduced. However, this information can be made available through omics studies. Huge data accumulated from the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analysis can be exploited to identify the gene of interest for a desired trait.

**5.1 Traditional tree breeding approaches**
Forest tree breeding begins with the visual selection of trees with desired phenotypic properties from the wild. These trees, which express a superior phenotype, are called plus trees. Plus trees may produce progeny via controlled or open pollination. In open pollination, the full parentage is unknown as pollination is allowed to take place naturally via insects, wind, or birds in an open-air environment. In contrast, in controlled pollination, naturally occurring pollination is prevented and done manually with pollen collected from a known tree. Progeny testing followed by further selection and breeding using the new generation will then follow. To determine the most suitable individuals, and their genotype-by-environment interaction on the phenotype, plus trees and their progeny are preferably tested under various environmental and stress conditions (Rosvall and Mullin, 2013).

Plus trees or their progeny may be multiplied for seed production and other purposes via grafting. Grafting is an asexual propagation practice in which a shoot from the plus tree is taken as a scion and connected to the roots and base of a seedling belonging to the same species or to a species with close taxonomic affinity. In a successful graft, there will be wound healing at the graft union zone. The two tree segments will grow together and form one functioning vascular system (Goldschmidt, 2014). The seedling will functionally be a clone of the original plus tree above the graft union zone. Grafts may be used to produce seeds for further testing in the breeding program, tree nurseries, or forest stand regeneration.

**5.1.1 Relevant features in traditional tree breeding**
In comparison with the breeding of agricultural plant, forest tree breeding is different due to long breeding cycles spanning a few years in the case of Eucalyptus sp. to decades with boreal conifers. The industrial applications of wood and the needs of consumers shift during these long cycles. These changes have historically been difficult to predict. The length of tree breeding cycles is due to the slow growth and maturation of trees. Economically significant attributes like wood properties cannot be assessed until the tree is sufficiently old (El-Kassaby and Klápste, 2016). Reaching sexual maturity takes a long time for trees, which lengthens the breeding cycle (Nagano et al., 2020). However, some new results suggest that wood properties should be assessed at quite young ages in Norway spruce. According to Hallingbäck et al. (2018), genetic gain per unit time for Norway spruce is optimized when selection for wood density and grain angle is done between the ages of 10 and 16 years.

A topical issue related to the long time span of tree breeding is climate change and the impact it will have on growth conditions, as well as reliable estimation (Häggman et al., 2016; Lebedev et al., 2020). When preparing for the changing climate, material from climates, which are believed to resemble the climate of the future, may be incorporated (Häggman et al., 2016; Westin and Haapanen, 2013). In addition to increasing temperatures, climate change also leads to extreme weather phenomena becoming more common. Drought, heat waves, heavy rain, and storm require resilience and stress tolerance from trees. In addition, abiotic damage caused by the extreme phenomena may be followed by biotic stressors like fungi and insects, which benefit from the tree’s impaired resistance. Tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress factors is an attribute that is affected by many traits, which have variation within a population. Resistance or tolerance to abiotic and biotic stressors may hence be pursued via breeding programs. Additionally, epigenetic modification may be used by breeders to adapt to heat stress and drought conditions caused by climate change (Sow et al., 2018). For example, the climate conditions during the embryonic development of P. abies permanently affect its epigenetic memory, leading to the timing of budding of a tree and its progenies to be altered through transcriptomic changes (Yakovlev et al., 2014, 2016). A similar effect has been observed in other conifers, like Picea glauca, Pinus sylvestris, and Larix spp. (Yakovlev et al., 2014). Epigenetic mechanisms may potentially be utilized to help boreal conifers adapt to increasing heat stress.

Institutional Arrangements for Breeding and Benefit Sharing
Institutional arrangements for breeding and benefit sharing impact on the distribution of costs and benefits associated with tree breeding. Historically, access to genetic resources of tree species has seldom been restricted; more usually, access has been facilitated by strong cooperation between countries and between public and private sectors. For reasons outlined above, most tree breeding programs began, and many remain, in the public domain, and have been judged against broader economic, rather than narrower financial, criteria. However, tree genetic resources and breeding activities are becoming increasingly proprietary, mirroring more general trade and intellectual property regimes. These changes challenge some of the important assumptions on which public investments in tree breeding have been made, and are likely to make breeding of some species more economically attractive and that of others less so.

Public-sector entities investing in breeding are likely to have different performance criteria than private investors, leading to different forms of economic evaluation. They may, for example, be willing to incorporate consideration of externalities, such as the potential for industry development or employment generation, the maintenance of rural livelihoods, or the delivery of environmental services, into evaluations; they are also likely to have access to lower-cost capital, and have a longer time horizon, than private sector investors. Where the investment is part of a development assistance program, as has been the case for both industrial and nonindustrial tree species, economic criteria may be very broadly defined, for example, the potential to contribute to sustainable livelihoods, or to address environmental degradation. However, in such cases, it is likely that investment in tree breeding will still need to be justified against alternative investment options.

**5 Genetics of tree resistance: Marker-assisted selection, genomic selection (GS), and functional relevance in disease resistance breeding**
Usually, the primary objective of a conventional forest tree breeding program is to select the best traits of great economic value such as growth, form, and wood quality. This improves the economic viability of the stands consisting of refined seedling or seed material. Quality refers to improved timber or fiber properties. In recent years, disease resistance traits have received more attention in tree breeding programs. Resistance to a variety of abiotic and biotic stress factors is an important trait when it comes to the successful regeneration of a stand, as more resilient genotypes have a higher survival rate. Properties such as birch trees’ resistance to damage caused by mammals (Rousi, 1990; http://hdl.handle.net/1975/9312). Scots pine’s resistance to rot may be improved via breeding as the traits have genetic variation within populations (Rieksts-Riekstiņš et al., 2019).

**5.1 Traditional tree breeding approaches**
Forest tree breeding begins with the visual selection of trees with desired phenotypic properties from the wild. These trees, which express a superior phenotype, are called plus trees. Plus trees may produce progeny via controlled or open pollination.

When preparing for the changing climate, material from climates, which are believed to resemble the climate of the future, may be incorporated (Häggman et al., 2016; Westin and Haapanen, 2013).

Epigenetic mechanisms may potentially be utilized to help boreal conifers adapt to increasing heat stress.

**5.2 Marker-based selection methods**
Markers are heritable traits that allow for the recognition of the underlying genotype (Muranty et al., 2014). Genetic markers are fragments of DNA with known loci. Examples of genetic markers used in marker-based breeding methods are single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), single sequence repeat (SSR), and the presence or absence of a DNA fragment in the genome (Lebedev et al., 2020). Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS) are methods of genetic screening that use genetic markers. GS and MAS are based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers and the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) or the trait desired by the breeding program (Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011; Muranty et al., 2014). LD refers to a situation in which alleles located in different loci are more or less likely to appear together compared to a completely random distribution. This means that alleles in LD are more (or less) likely to be inherited together when the level of recombination is low. In practice, the presence of a desired trait can be predicted based on the presence of markers. With marker-based screening methods, breeding selection may be targeted at markers instead of the desired trait and selection may be performed before the desired traits even manifest (Lebedev et al., 2020).

MAS and GS differ in their use of markers. In MAS, only a few markers are used. These markers are in LD with a QTL that has a substantial impact on the phenotype (major effect gene). In GS, many markers in LD with minor-effect genes are considered (Lebedev et al., 2020). MAS may be more suitable when breeding for a trait with a simple genetic architecture and GS when breeding for multiple traits and/or a trait with a complex genetic architecture. GS, unlike MAS, does not require prior knowledge of the connection between markers and QTLs (Desta and Ortiz, 2014; Lebedev et al., 2020). In GS, thousands of markers are used and their genome-wide impact is considered. This increases the probability that the desired traits are in LD with at least one marker in the entire population and hence does not require the mapping of QTLs (Desta and Ortiz, 2014). The likelihood of successful application of marker-based screening methods is improved by high marker density (markers per centimorgan, cM) and close position. The likelihood that a marker and QTL are inherited together during chromosomal crossover increases when the distance in cM is low (Muranty et al., 2014).

Screening methods based on markers may serve as a solution to time span-related problems of traditional breeding. They may be used to shorten the period needed for progeny testing (Lenz et al., 2020). Progeny selection could be cut down from 20 to 25 years to 1 to 2 years. During the past decade, interest in tree breeding has shifted from MAS to GS (Muranty et al., 2014; Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011). GS is a promising method, because phenotype predictions based on GS models have been more accurate than the MAS-based equivalents in both animal and plant breeding (Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011; Lebedev et al., 2020).

**5.3 Genomic selection in breeding for resistance traits against pathogens**
Genomic selection (GS) was proposed by Meuwissen et al. (2001), and it was suggested as a potential future alternative to traditional breeding. It is based on a genome-wide analysis of markers and QTL effects (Beaulieu et al., 2020). GS was first utilized in animal breeding, followed by its utilization in crop plant breeding (Desta and Ortiz, 2014). GS is still a new tool that has had little application in forest tree breeding. In a review published in November 2020, Lebedev et al. listed only 58 studies that discussed GS in forest tree breeding to varying degrees. The tree species used in most GS have been of the Picea, Pinus, or Eucalyptus genera. These three are the most common tree genera grown in plantations and hence economically the most significant (Lebedev et al., 2020).

First simulation studies and experimental studies on the potential of GS in forest tree breeding were published roughly about 10 years ago. For example, Grattapaglia et al. (2011) and Iwata et al. (2011) are some of the first simulation studies dealing with GS in forest tree breeding. These early studies, like most studies to this day, were concerned with directly economically significant traits such as growth rate and wood properties. In addition to growth and wood properties, Resende Jr et al. (2012a,b) considered the fusiform rust resistance of Pinus taeda. This study evaluated the prediction accuracy of four methods of GS on 17 different traits of P. taeda. The traits chosen had differing genetic architectures. Fusiform rust resistance has a simple genetic architecture and is controlled by a few major-effect genes. In the case of fusiform rust resistance, Bayes Cπ, Bayes A, and modified ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP B) were found to have a higher predictive ability compared to ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) and Bayesian LASSO. In addition to Resende Jr et al. (2012a,b), the report by Lebedev et al. (2020) lists only five other studies dealing with disease or pest resistance traits. Some of these experimental studies focused on resistance traits under greenhouse conditions.

**5.3.1 Case studies on the use of genomic selection for nonresistance traits**
Most studies on genomic selection in forest tree breeding have been concerned with breeding for improved growth and wood properties (physical and chemical). As of November 2020, out of the 58 studies listed by Lebedev et al., 55 studies dealt with these traits. This may be due to these being the most economically significant traits of forest trees in terms of lumber, pulp, and paper production. Physical wood property traits that have been considered in GS studies have included fiber length, coarseness, number of fibers per gram, and density. Examples of chemical wood property traits that have been considered are, among other traits, α-cellulose content and syringyl/guaiacyl ratio (Lebedev et al., 2020). Height and diameter at breast height (DBH) are used as indicators of growth in many studies. They are complex traits with low heritability and are hence suited better for GS than for MAS.

Perhaps due to the smaller-scale monetary value they provide, only a few studies have dealt with species-specific traits not related to biomass accumulation or quality. Cros et al. (2019) investigated the potential of GS in breeding for improved rubber production in Hevea brasiliensis. According to the findings of Cros et al. (2019), a breeding program combining GS and traditional phenotypic selection would yield more productive trees. In another study concerned with species-specific traits, Kainer et al. (2019) evaluated the possibility of improving the essential oil production of Eucalyptus polybractea by using GS. Kainer et al. (2019) also evaluated the accuracy of GS models when predicting the eucalyptus oil production of E. polybractea. According to the findings, the predictive ability of all models used was higher for individual terpene concentrations in comparison with the total oil concentration. In the same study, the predictive accuracy of two biomass properties (height and absolute change in height per year) was also considered. The predictive ability across all five models contrasted in the study was lower for biomass properties compared to oil concentration. This demonstrated the potential of using GS in breeding for traits outside of growth and wood property traits such as disease resistance.

**5.3.2 Methodology of genomic selection**
The process of genomic selection roughly proceeds as follows: 1) phenotyping and genotyping the training population (TP), 2) building a predictive GS model based on data derived from the TP, 3) validating and refining the model with data derived from a TP’s known phenotype and genotype, and 4) applying the model to calculate genetic estimated breeding value (GEBV) of the breeding population (BP). Step 3 may be combined with step 4 by validating and refining the model based on data derived from the BP. The phenotype of the BP will not generally be assessed unless the BP is used for validating the predictive GS model. The genotype of the BP is known and used to calculate GEBV. The trees within the BP with the most promising GEBVs will be selected for breeding (Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011; Desta and Ortiz, 2014; Lebedev et al., 2020). The steps of GS are illustrated in Fig. 2.6. The GS model may be applied to calculate GEBVs for embryos, seeds, and seedlings. The genomic value of a tree can hence be estimated without having to wait for the tree to mature (Lenz et al., 2020). Genomic markers also have other more promising uses, especially in boreal conifers which do not gain from early selection. One such method is the use of genomic relationship matrices for genomic selection (often called genomic-assisted selection or GBLUP) In a study involving nine full-sib Pinus taeda families, Zapata-Valenzuela et al. (2013) found that predictions derived from genomic relations established using markers were as accurate as those derived from a conventional relation matrix based on pedigree. But unlike models derived solely from pedigree-based relation matrices, marker-based genomic relation matrices allow for the identification of individual trees with the highest breeding values within full-sib families by accounting for Mendelian segregation. Matrices for genomic selection may be a valuable addition to breeding programs in terms of forward selection (Zapata-Valenzuela et al., 2013).

Fig. 2.6. Scheme illustrating the genomic selection workflow. The phenotypic and genotypic information of the training population is used to build a predictive model. The predictive model and the genotypic information of the breeding population (BP) are used to calculate genetic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Selection is done based on GEBVs. Refining the model postselection with new data derived from either the BP or the test population will improve the predictive ability of the model. The inclusion of a test population (green arrows) in the breeding program is optional. The test population may consist of the BP or a subpopulation of it.

The aim of the predictive GS models is to produce estimated breeding values based on genomic data. An estimated breeding value is a numeric description of an individual’s merit in the framework of a breeding program. Traditionally estimated breeding value is based on phenotypic data and calculated using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) (Meuwissen et al., 2001), but in GS, it is done by only using genomic data. Genetic estimated breeding value (GEBV) was first proposed alongside GS by Meuwissen et al. (2001). Methods used to build models in forest tree breeding with GS have been modifications of BLUP and methods based on Bayesian estimation. Several comparative studies have been executed to determine the accuracy of models produced using different methods for different traits. For example, Resende Jr et al. (2012a,b) compared the accuracy of methods RR-BLUP, BLASSO, Bayes A, and Bayes Cπ for different traits of Pinus taeda. For fusiform rust resistance, Bayes A and Bayes Cπ had the highest predictive accuracy. Fusiform rust resistance has a simple genetic architecture consisting of a few large-effect genes. Alternative methods behave differently according to the genetic architecture of the desired trait. Some methods can hence be preferred over others depending on the trait (Resende Jr et al., 2012a,b).

**5.3.2.1 Phenotyping**
In GS, phenotypic information is not commonly used in the selection process itself like in traditional breeding, but in constructing a predictive model (Araus and Cairns, 2014). A model that produces precise GEBVs requires meticulous phenotyping of the training population (Desta and Ortiz, 2014). This may be challenging as a plant’s phenotype is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Compared to agricultural crops, trees as perennial plants are influenced by environmental factors to a great extent due to the stress caused by seasonal variation in weather (Lebedev et al., 2020). The influence of environmental factors is illustrated by the findings of Resende Jr et al. (2012a,b). According to Resende Jr et al. (2012a,b), predictive GS models have a limited accuracy across site for at least diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height (HT) of Pinus taeda. For HT, GS model accuracy was 0.64–0.74 on-site, while across site, it was only 0.23–0.66. For DBH, accuracy was 0.65–0.73 on-site, while across site, it was 0.23–0.66. The possibility of improving the accuracy of GS models when used across site by incorporating genotype-by-environment interaction should be considered. The findings by Chen et al. (2018) also support this conclusion, as a 30% decrease in GS model accuracy for P. abies height was observed when the model was used across site.

Although multienvironmental phenotyping has not been widely practiced in GS studies of forest trees, phenotyping even on a single site requires a large amount of space, time, and human resources. Instead of genotyping, phenotyping is currently more often the limiting step when setting the size of the training population (Lebedev et al., 2020). High-throughput phenotyping platforms or HTPPs are tools used in phenotyping agricultural crops based on remote sensing of symptomatic effects of abiotic and biotic stressors (Araus and Cairns, 2014). They could be used to make phenotyping forest trees for breeding more efficient as well as provide noninvasive methods, making multienvironmental phenotyping a realistic option.

So far, there has been limited research on the use of HTPPs in phenotyping forest trees for breeding. Ludovisi et al. (2017) used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and thermal infrared imaging to assess the effects of different water treatments on aspen stands. One plot was well-watered, and the other experienced moderate drought. Ludovisi et al. (2017) concluded that thermal infrared imaging was effective in recognizing trees resistant to drought. The study demonstrates that HTPPs have the potential to reduce the resources needed for phenotyping in the context of GS as well.

**5.3.2.2 Genotyping**
Genotyping refers to the process of examining genetic differences in the genome of an individual compared to the rest of the population. DNA for genotyping may, for example, be extracted with commercially available kits from the wood, leaves, or needles. Genotyping is no longer a factor that limits the size of the training population (TP). This is partly due to the development and improvement of next-generation sequencing and analysis of large sets of data. Development of the technology has made GS into an alternative screening method worth considering within the past decade (Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011; Lebedev et al., 2020).

The genotype of the TP must be assessed for correlations between desired traits and markers. For marker-QTL connections to be discovered, marker density needs to be sufficiently high (Grattapaglia and Resende, 2011). Although higher marker density improves predictive ability, returns will diminish. Single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs are commonly used as markers in experimental studies on forest tree breeding. SNPs are a phenomenon in which a one-nucleotide-sized change appears in a minimum of 1% of the population. SNPs do not change the overall length of the DNA sequence. In practice, this means that in a specific locus of the genome, a base (A, T, C, or G) is replaced with another specific base in a minimum of 1% of the population. In research regarding GS in forest tree breeding, the most common method of genotyping is SNP marker array or analysis of SNP markers with a DNA chip (Lebedev et al., 2020). SNP marker arrays are available commercially for a variety of species and marker densities. The most used genotyping platform in forest tree studies is the Illumina Infinium platform.
