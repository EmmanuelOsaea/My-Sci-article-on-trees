Our mission for creating this article is to spread awareness regarding the impact of tree breeding in our society.Tree breeding programs are designed to develop genetically improved varieties used for reforestation and afforestation.

**Tree Breeding and the Problem of the Environment**
The discovery of genetic gain to the forest grower is one of the most important drivers for commercial tree breeding programs (e.g., [15]). 

**Conclusions**
Tree breeding programs develop genetically improved varieties for forestation through repeated cycles of activities such as selection, breeding, and genetic testing.  

**Introduction**
Tree breeding programs, also called tree improvement programs, create genetically improved varieties for reforestation and afforestation. 

**Breeding methodologies**
Conventional plant breeding has been a long-driven process of selection and crossing of elite varieties to generate superior varieties .

**Traditional tree breeding approaches**
Forest tree breeding begins with the visual selection of trees with desired phenotypic properties from the wild. 

**Relevant features in traditional tree breeding**
In comparison with the breeding of agricultural plant, forest tree breeding is different due to long breeding cycles spanning a few years in the case of Eucalyptus. 

**Genetics of tree resistance: Marker-assisted selection, genomic selection (GS), and functional relevance in disease resistance breeding**
Usually, the primary objective of a conventional forest tree breeding program is to select the best traits of great economic value such as growth, form, and wood quality. 

**Relevant features in traditional tree breeding**
In comparison with the breeding of agricultural plant, forest tree breeding is different due to long breeding cycles spanning a few years in the case of Eucalyptus. 

**Marker-based selection methods**
Markers are heritable traits that allow for the recognition of the underlying genotype (Muranty et al., 2014). 

**Genomic selection in breeding for resistance traits against pathogens**
Genomic selection (GS) was proposed by Meuwissen et al. 

**Case studies on the use of genomic selection for nonresistance traits**
Most studies on genomic selection in forest tree breeding have been concerned with breeding for improved growth and wood properties (physical and chemical). 

**Methodology of genomic selection**
The process of genomic selection roughly proceeds as follows: 1) phenotyping and genotyping the training population (TP), 2) building a predictive GS model based on data derived from the TP, 3) validating and refining the model with data derived from a TPâ€™s known phenotype and genotype, and 4) applying the model to calculate genetic estimated breeding value (GEBV) of the breeding population (BP). 

**Genotyping**
Genotyping refers to the process of examining genetic differences in the genome of an individual compared to the rest of the population.
